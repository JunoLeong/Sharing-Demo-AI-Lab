# Product Sync — Mobile App v2.1
## 2025-09-24, 10:00–10:30

### Attendees
Alice (PM), Ben (Eng Lead), Chloe (Design), Dan (QA)

### Agenda
* Onboarding funnel drop-offs
* Release v2.1 dates & scope
* Support load after v2.0

### Key Points
* Crash rate after v2.0 hotfix is 0.18%
* New empty state mockups ready Friday
* We must improve Step 2 completion; propose shorter profile form
* Test coverage for payment edge cases at 76%. Needs more cases.

### Decisions
* Shorten onboarding Step 2 to a single screen (was 2). Target in v2.1.
* Keep A/B test for copy on Step 1; no change this week.

### Risks
* Support backlog rising; Alice to re-check staffing by next week.
